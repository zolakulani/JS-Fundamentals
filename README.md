## Tasks

### 0. First constant, first print
Write a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”:
* You must create a constant variable called `myVar` with the value “JavaScript is amazing”
* You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
* You are not allowed to use `var`

```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x12$ node 0-javascript_is_amazing.js 
JavaScript is amazing
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x12$```

### 1. 3 languages
Write a script that prints 3 lines:
* The first line: “C is fun”
* The second line: “Python is cool”
* The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
* You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
* You are not allowed to use `var`

```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x12$ node 1-multi_languages.js 
C is fun
Python is cool
JavaScript is amazing
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x12$
